## Panels
The website has three main panels:
### Admin Panel
The main section of this site is the **Admin Panel**. Here, you can perform **CRUD** operations on:
* Students
* Teachers
* Courses
### Student Panel
You can log in to this panel by providing the student's *Roll No.* and *Password* —which was set by the admin— and view **Your Student Details**.
### Teacher Panel
Similar to the student panel, you can log in to this panel by providing the teacher's *ID* and *Password* —which was set by the admin— and view **Your Teacher Details**.
