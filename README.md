# CMS
This is my first Full Stack Project الحمدللہ, a Basic [**College Management System**](https://cms-abulkalam.vercel.app/).
It has three main panels:
* Admin Panel
* Student Panel
* Teacher Panel
## Panels
  ### Admin Panel
  The main section of this site is the **Admin Panel**. Here, you can perform CRUD operations on:
  * Students
  * Teachers
  * Courses
  ### Student Panel
  You can log in to this panel by providing the student's *Roll No.* and *Password* —which was set by the admin— and view **Your Student Details**.
  ### Teacher Panel
  Similar to the student panel, you can log in to this panel by providing the teacher's *ID* and *Password* —which was set by the admin— and view **Your Teacher Details**.
